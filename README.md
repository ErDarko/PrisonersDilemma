# ðŸŽ® Prisoner's Dilemma
## Welcome to the Prisoner's Dilemma Gameâ€”an interactive simulation of the classic game theory problem where strategy and decision-making are key!

## What is the Prisoner's Dilemma?
The Prisoner's Dilemma is a well-known scenario in game theory that explores the conflict between individual self-interest and collective benefit. Hereâ€™s a quick overview:

## The Scenario
Two suspects are arrested and interrogated separately. They are each given the choice to either:

- __Stay Silent__: If both stay silent, they both receive a light sentence.
- __Betray the Other__: If one betrays (confesses) while the other stays silent, the betrayer goes free while the silent one gets a heavy sentence.
- __Both Betray:__ If both betray each other, they both get a moderate sentence.

## The Dilemma
The dilemma illustrates why two rational individuals might not cooperate, even if it appears to be in their best interest. While mutual silence would lead to the best joint outcome, each suspect faces the temptation to betray the other for a potentially better personal outcome, leading to a less optimal result for both.

## Real-World Relevance
